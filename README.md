🚗 Smart Parking Management System

An IoT-based Smart Parking System that integrates ESP32 hardware, ultrasonic sensors, and a Flask web application to provide real-time parking monitoring, reservations, session tracking, and payment management.

---

📌 Project Overview

This system enables:

- Real-time parking slot detection
- Online slot reservation
- Parking session tracking
- Automated billing and payment
- Admin monitoring dashboard
- Gate-level operational dashboard
- Integration of IoT hardware with web technologies

---

🧠 Technologies Used

🔧 Hardware

- ESP32 Microcontroller
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensors (×3)
- SG90 Servo Motor (Gate Control)

💻 Software

- Python (Flask Framework)
- SQLite Database
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript

💳 Payment Integration

- Razorpay (Online Payments)
- Cash Payment (Admin Entry)

---

⚙️ System Architecture

Parking Area → Sensors → ESP32 → Serial → Flask Backend → SQLite → Web Dashboards

---

🚘 Features

👤 User Features

- User Registration & Login
- View live parking slots
- Reserve parking slots
- View current parking session
- View parking history
- Online payment (Razorpay)

---

🛠️ Admin Features

- Dashboard for full system monitoring
- View live parking status
- Manage parking sessions
- Manage reservations
- Record cash payments
- View statistics and history

---

🚪 Gate Dashboard

- No login required
- Displays real-time slot status
- Shows:
  - EMPTY
  - RESERVED
  - OCCUPIED
- Displays gate and hardware status

---

🅿️ Parking Slot Logic

Condition| Status
No vehicle + No reservation| 🟢 EMPTY
Reservation exists + No vehicle| 🟡 RESERVED
Vehicle detected| 🔴 OCCUPIED

---

🔌 Hardware Configuration

Ultrasonic Sensors

Slot| TRIG| ECHO
Slot 1| GPIO 5| GPIO 18
Slot 2| GPIO 4| GPIO 19
Slot 3| GPIO 23| GPIO 22

«⚠️ Only ECHO uses a voltage divider before ESP32»

---

Servo Motor (Gate Control)

- Signal → GPIO 13
- Logic:
  - If at least one slot is available → Gate OPEN
  - If all slots are occupied → Gate CLOSED

---

📡 Parking Detection Logic

Distance < 10 cm → OCCUPIED
Distance ≥ 10 cm → EMPTY

Multiple readings are used to improve accuracy and reduce noise.

---

🔄 System Flow

User Flow

Register → Login → View Slots → Reserve → Park → Exit → Payment → History

Admin Flow

Login → Dashboard → Monitor → Manage Sessions → Manage Reservations → Payments

Gate Flow

Open Dashboard → View Live Status → Monitor Gate

---

🗄️ Database

- Database: SQLite
- File: "parking.db" (not pushed to GitHub)

Key Tables:

- "users"
- "reservations"
- "parking_sessions"

«⚠️ Reservations and normal parking sessions are handled separately»

---

💳 Payment System

Online Payment

- Razorpay integration
- Order creation → Payment → Verification

Offline Payment

- Admin can record cash payments

«⚠️ Payment is allowed only after vehicle exit (session must be completed)»

---

🌐 API Endpoints (Important)

"/gate"| Gate Dashboard
"/status"| Live slot status
"/reservations"| Manage reservations
"/sessions"| Parking sessions
"/history"| Parking history
